### Summary

* **Personal and educational use** is fully allowed, as long as proper attribution is given.
* **Commercial use** requires explicit permission. You must contact the author for permission. A fee or other compensation may be required depending on whether you are considered a trusted party - as per the Rules themselves.
* **Forking** is allowed, but you must maintain the attribution in the Rules themselves as-is (e.g. `# The Rules (v1.0 by xayan.nu)`).
* **Best way to stay compliant** is to give links to specific versions of Rules within GitHub (see repo's tags), rather than copy-pasting them. Clone the repo if you need to automate their use.
* **Don't use the `master` branch** unless you like surprises.
